# Learning CircuitPython
 Im currently learning Circuitpython to use with a Pi Pico and other Microcontrollers. This Repository houses all the small experiments that I have done to learn how the language and hardware works, outside of bigger project.
 Currently I am using a Raspberry Pi Pico for most of these projects, you can see which microcontroller is used in the "boot_out" text file in each folder, along with what version of CircuitPython used.
 All libraries belong to the their respective owners (such as the Adafruit CircuitPython files belonging to Adafruit Industries and their contributors, the HD44780 library belongs to Bernhard Bablok)
