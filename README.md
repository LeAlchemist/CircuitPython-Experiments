# CircuitPython Experiments
 Im currently learning Circuitpython to use with a Pi Pico and other Microcontrollers. This Repository houses all the small experiments that I have done to learn how the language and hardware works, outside of bigger project.<br/>
 Currently I am using a Raspberry Pi Pico for most of these projects, you can see which microcontroller is used in the "boot_out" text file in each folder, along with what version of CircuitPython used.<br/>
 All libraries belong to the their respective owners (such as the [Adafruit CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython) files belonging to Adafruit Industries and their contributors, the [HD44780 library](https://github.com/bablokb/circuitpython-hd44780) belongs to Bernhard Bablok)<br/>
